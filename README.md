## Motivation

Google released Lighthouse back in 2016, it’s a tool to analyze websites and help website builders to follow Google’s golden standard (Mobile friendly, good accessibility, loading speed… ) on websites.

IntelligentHost is a tool that helps Turo to have hosts globally proactively update their car page to match our “standards” (instant book, quality photos, appealing description, more delivery options, useful extras….etc) in a repeatable, stable, and transparent manner, by simply tuning the “rules” and “AI engine”.
